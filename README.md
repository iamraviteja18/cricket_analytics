The projects in this folder are done by Ravi Teja Rajavarapu (ravitejarajavarapu515@gmail)
1) Best ODI player analytics.ipynb: This is a project to identify best One Day International Cricketers among Fab4 (Virat Kohli, Steven Smith, Joe Root, Kane Williamson) and also Rohit Sharma
data for all these cricketers have been scrapped from StatGuru API (Espncricinfo) based on the requirements, this project is all about comparative analysis between players. 
The major part and most time consuming process in this project is data cleaning, there were so many aspects to be taken care of. Visualization of the data after analysis is also done in this project

2) Virat Kohli.pdf: This project is to analyze Virat Kohli's ODI stats, types of dismissals, consistency in maintaining averages,his conversion rate from 50's to 100's and bowlers who dismissed him the most were all visualized in graphical way. (If there's any problem in loading the graphs, try to download the pdf for better vision)

3) IPL 2020 Predicitions inefficient way.ipynb: In this Project I have scrapped data from various sources to build a few  Machine Learning models to precict match winner in IPL 2020, 
Here Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression were tried to see if the model can predict but only ended up to figure out that they are not very efficient to predict match winner

4) IPL 2020 Predicitions-Matchday ML.ipynb: In this project I have used the data that I have scrapped from various sources to build a Supervised Machine Learning Model (Random Forest) to predict match winner in IPL 2020,
I have made two models to identify winner (i) Pre-toss Prediction (ii) Post-toss Prediction , considering certain factors that will add up after toss like (toss won by, toss decision) to improvise the ability to predict accurately,
I have also done Parameter Tuning to increase accuracy of the model (f-score of this model is 78.69)
